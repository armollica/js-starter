# JavaScript starter repo

Template for JavaScript packages meant to run in the browser and in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

The package structure is based on [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) modules like [d3-dsv](https://github.com/d3/d3-dsv).

## Usage

1. In `package.json` and `rollup.config.js` replace the "js-starter" bits with your package name.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run build` to test, lint and minify the JavaScript package.

If you need to tweak the build process check out:
